# KNN Algorithm - Machine Learning
## Introduction
In this exercise we will touch the world of [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).  
Machine learning is a branch of [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.  

In particular, we will implement the [KNN algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) (K-Nearest-Neighbors). The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as **KNN**, is a non-parametric, [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.  

**Let's give an example:**  
Let's say we have three types of images of animals: images of cats, images of dogs, and images of birds. Now, we get a new image as an input, and without knowing anything about that image, we want to say whether it is an image of a dog, a cat, or a bird. We can't really say what is in the image, but based on images we have checked in the past, we know that the new image is very similar to images of dogs, so we can tag the new image as an image of a dog. We can continue like this iteratively and rely on our new tags.

## Running Instructions
In the ML tasks, and in particular in this task, we will use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run the code in an iterative and convenient way.  
To preview the notebook, you can click on `KNN.ipynb` in this repository.  
In the notebook you can find a detailed explanation about the algorithm and the code step by step.  
To run the code, first clone the repository to your computer with `git clone https://github.com/ido106/KNN-ML.git`, then drag the notebook (`KNN.ipynb`) to your [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/).  

**Enjoy !**
